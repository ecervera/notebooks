All those default parameters are specified in the <a href=\"http://pyevolve.sourceforge.net/0_6rc1/module_const.html#module-Consts\">Consts</a> module (and you are highly encouraged to take a look at source code).\n",

    "<p>Let’s begin with the first simple example. First of all, you must know your problem, in this case, our problem is to find a simple 1D list of integers of n-size with zero in all positions. At the first look, we know by intuition that the representation needed to this problem is a 1D List, which you can found in Pyevolve by the name of <a href=\"http://pyevolve.sourceforge.net/0_6rc1/module_g1dlist.html#G1DList.G1DList\">G1DList.G1DList</a>, which means Genome 1D List. This representation is based on a python list as you will see, and is very easy to manipulate. The next step is to define the our evaluation function to our Genetic Algorithm. We want all the $n$ list positions with value of ‘0’, so we can propose the evaluation function:\n",
